# crna-boilerplate

This project was Bootstrapped using CRNA.

It contains the minimum directories required for most react-native projects each directory comes with an empty index file. 

More functionalities will be included as time goes on, PR's to improve functionalities are always welcomed

## Requirements 


* Make sure you have Node v6 or later installed. No Xcode or Android Studio installation is required.

* Expo App 

## Getting Started

To run clone the app to your local machine using 

* `git clone git@github.com:obie3/crna-boilerplate.git` in your terminal

* `cd` into the newly created project root directory

* run `npm install`  in your terminal to install the needed node js packages.

If you're familiar with React Native already, you won't find any `ios` or `android` directories in this project, just JavaScript. Once this installation is done, there are some commands you can run in the project directory:

Install the [Expo](https://expo.io) app on your iOS or Android phone, and use the QR code in the terminal to open your app. Find the QR scanner on the Projects tab of the app. When you're ready to share your project with others (for example, by deploying to an app store), read the [Sharing & Deployment](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md#sharing-and-deployment) section of the User Guide.

#### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the `--no-interactive` flag.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).

#### `npm run eject`

This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.

**Warning:** Running eject is a **permanent** action. Please use a version control system, such as git, so you can revert back if necessary. An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) set up.
